/*
Why OOPS?
➡ C++ language was designe with the main intention of adding object oriented features to C language
➡ As the size of the program increases, readability , maintainbility and bug - free nature of program decreases
➡ As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high
➡ Also, as data was almost negleted, data security was easily compromised
➡ Using classes this problems can be solve by modelling program as a real world scenario
➡ Works on the concept of classes and objects
➡ A class is a template to create objects
➡ Treat data as a critical element
➡ Decomposes the problem in objects and build data and functions around the objects
*/

/*
BASIC KNOWLEDGE ON OOPS
➡ 1.Classes - Basic template for creating objects.
➡ 2.Objects - Basic run time entities.
➡ 3.Data Abstraction & Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into single unit.
➡ 4.Inheritence - Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
➡ 5.Polymorphism - Ability to take more than one forms.
➡ 6.Dynamic Binding - Code which will execute is not known until the program.
➡ 7.Message Passing - Object.message(information) call format.
*/

/*
BENIFITS OF OOPS
➡ Better code reusability using objects and inheritence
➡ Principle of data hiding helps build secure system
➡ Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference
➡ Software complexity can be easily managed

/*
    LIMITATIONS OF STRUCTURES
    1. members are public
    2. no methods

    class = structure + more
    1. can have methods and properties
    2. members can be prvate and as well as public
